LearnSizers*
============

LearnSizers.zip is a collection of small standalone applications aimed to
learn the sizers of the wxPython GUI toolkit and their usage.

The LearnSizer8 is quite different in its structure from the previous releases.
It has been deeply reworked.

The latest version has been tested/developed using Python 2.5.4 and 
wxPython 2.8.9.1-ansi.

Should be ok with Python 2.6, although not completed tested.

See SizerStartHere.py for an example explaining the structure of the
test applications.

Tip for beginners. Start with WithBoxSizers.py .
